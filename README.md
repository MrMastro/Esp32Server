# Esp32Server

Local Server for esp32 projects

To load settings rename .\data\settings\defaultSettings.json into .\data\settings\settings.json and modify

RoadMap:

 - 1.0.0:
    - [x] Base features
- 1.1.0:
	- [x] Settings model loaded by file (feature/1.1.0_setting_load_with_file)
	- [ ] Bluetooth access: Connection, Terminal and more  (WIP)
	- [ ] Set setting by SettingService to modify only or more value into Settings s
	- [ ] Settings modify with Serial usb, Serial Web and Serial bluetooth (To think)
	- [ ] Create a doc with protocol for communicate with serial.

Other features but not planning:
- Esp32 with more security protocol like https, ssl and certificate.
