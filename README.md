# Esp32Server

Local Server for esp32 projects

To load settings rename .\data\settings\defaultSettings.json into .\data\settings\settings.json and modify

RoadMap:
1.0.0:
    Base features
1.1.0:
    -Settings model loaded by file (OK: feature/1.1.0_setting_load_with_file)
    -Bluetooth access: Connection, Terminal and more  (WIP)
    -Set setting by SettingService to modify only or more value into Settings s
    -Settings modify with Serial usb, Serial Web and Serial bluetooth (To think)
    -Create a doc with protocol for communicate with serial.

Other features but not planning:
    -Esp32 with more security protocol like https, ssl and certificate.
